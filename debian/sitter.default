# Define shell variables for the sitter_scripts plugin.

# The default shell for sitter is "/bin/false" so you cannot log in
# that account without some tricks (i.e. `su -s /bin/bash sitter`)
# So we have to define a proper shell interpretor in case the script
# needs it (which it does because files under /usr/share/... do not get
# their execution bits set.)
